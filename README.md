# offline-judge
Offline judge to compile and test your code with given input.

Works for c,cpp,java

How does it work-
1. Remove the files in test folder and output folder first.
2. Add your code(c,cpp,java) to the test folder and change the path in the code. 
3. Add any number of input text files. The name of the files should be just integers ie 1,2,3...
4. Similarly add expected output text files in output folder with same names
5. Run compiler-tester.py file

What is the result-
- Tests the codes ouput with expected outputs
- Prints how many test cases have passed
- Handles compilation errors
