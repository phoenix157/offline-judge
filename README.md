# offline-judge
Offline judge to compile and test your code with given input.

Works for c,cpp,java

How does it work-
1. Add your code(c,cpp,java) to the test folder
2. Add any number of input text files
3. The name of the files should be just integers ie 1,2,3...
4. Similarly add expected output text files in output folder with same names
5. Run compiler-tester.py file

What is the result-
- Tests the codes ouput with expected outputs
- Prints how many test cases have passed
- Handles compilation errors
